So I have been playing around a bit with foundation, css, and IOS Simulator. I assume iPod touch is pretty close to iphone. These are just a few options. You could have "Confirm Vote" there from the beginning (justConfirmVote.tiff), and if a member presses it without pressing Yes or No, that could in effect be used to abstain from the vote. Or you could have the grey button say "Abstain" (abstain.tiff) until "Yes" or "No" is pressed, then it changes to "Confirm Vote" (thenConfirmVote.tiff) with javascript (tried it). In that case, I guess there could be a subsequent "Confirm Abstain Vote" button page. Or to make it as simple and as quick as possible, just have all three be like three mutually exclusive radio buttons, and once all those members who are present's buttons have been pressed, the vote is tallied (this would require some integration with the clerks system of who is present and who isn't (or who is "logged in" and who isn't), and/or motions that have been passed to recuse a member from a vote.

I have thought about putting the text at the bottom so the buttons always stay in the same place, and/or putting the grey button above the yes/no buttons. I assume there is already a system in play with the Clerk that contains all the items that are on the current meeting's agenda. Maybe that database could sync with ours before the meeting?

On the idea about recording the motions, you could have a page before this one that has the item listed with a "Motion" button, to make a motion to approve the item - then everyone's button changes to "Second" - then when it is pressed it changes to the yes/no/abstain voting screen. The only thing is the process can move very fast and I am not sure how much button pressing they are going to want to be doing. Watch 2:19:37 - 2:21:37 from the August 27 video here ( http://charmeck.org/city/charlotte/CityCouncil/meetings/Pages/default.aspx ) for example.
